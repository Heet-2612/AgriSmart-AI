🌱 The Problem
Farmers can lose yield because crop diseases are diagnosed late, agricultural advice is generic, and irrigation and input usage are not sufficiently adapted to local conditions.
AgriSmart AI brings multiple decision-support capabilities into one platform:
Detect crop diseases from leaf images.
Reject unsuitable images and unsupported crops before disease prediction.
Combine local weather forecasts with practical farm alerts.
Recommend crops using soil and climate parameters.
Estimate sustainability using resource-efficiency indicators.
Accept simulated IoT telemetry.
Provide conversational assistance through an AI Agronomist.

🧠 AI Disease Detection
The disease-detection system uses a three-stage gated pipeline rather than sending every uploaded image directly to a disease classifier.

E14 — Leaf Presence Gate
A lightweight deterministic computer-vision gate checks whether an uploaded image plausibly contains leaf/vegetation content. It helps reject non-leaf images, soil/background scenes and degenerate inputs before ML classification.
E12 — Crop Validity Gate
A SigLIP-based validity classifier determines whether the image belongs to a supported crop or should be treated as `Other`.
E11 — Disease Predictor
The production disease model uses:
Backbone: SigLIP ViT-B/16
Architecture: frozen 768-dimensional encoder + trained 768→10 linear classification head
Input: 224×224 RGB
Inference: deterministic FP32 on CPU/CUDA
Model version: `E11-SigLIP-HYBRID10-PRODUCTION`

📊 Model Evaluation
The production E11 model uses a locked held-out field-condition test set for the primary result.
Evaluation Protocol	Accuracy	Macro-F1	Role
Held-out field-condition test	96.31%	95.07%	Primary result
PlantVillage validation	99.51%	98.96%	Validation
LOSO field-source diagnostic	64.72%	70.38%	Cross-source robustness diagnostic
PlantDoc diagnostic	69.19%	~69.5%	Post-hoc external diagnostic
Held-out field test size: 1,708 images.
Important Evaluation Note
These evaluation protocols answer different questions and should not be treated as interchangeable benchmarks.
The 96.31% / 95.07% result is the primary locked held-out field-condition evaluation.
LOSO measures generalization when entire field-data sources are held out during evaluation.
PlantDoc is a post-hoc external diagnostic and is not part of the production training pool.
PlantVillage validation is a curated validation set and is expected to be easier than real-field data.
Macro-F1 is emphasized because it gives equal importance to each class rather than allowing larger classes to dominate the metric.
Reproducibility
Inference is configured for deterministic FP32 execution across CPU/CUDA environments, with explicit device selection and backend determinism controls.
Evaluation Limitations
Performance can decrease under domain shift between curated/lab imagery and other field datasets. Visually similar disease/healthy classes and visually similar diseases remain challenging. The system therefore uses input-validity and confidence safeguards rather than presenting every prediction as certain.

🛡️ Safety & Reliability
AgriSmart AI is designed around a fail-safe diagnostic pipeline:
Non-leaf/invalid imagery can be rejected before disease inference.
Unsupported crops can be classified as `Other`.
Low-confidence predictions can be marked inconclusive.
The production disease model is isolated behind validation gates.
CPU/CUDA inference uses explicit FP32 configuration.
External conversational AI services are separate from the core disease-detection pipeline.
The system is a decision-support tool and should not be treated as a substitute for professional agronomic diagnosis.
---
⚠️ Limitations
Disease detection supports a defined set of crops/classes rather than all agricultural species.
Visual symptoms outside supported leaf-disease categories may not be diagnosed.
Domain shift between curated datasets and different real-world environments can reduce performance.
Visually similar diseases/classes remain challenging.
Weather intelligence depends on external weather-service availability.
The Agentic Advisor currently uses deterministic advisory logic; fully autonomous multi-agent tool chaining remains future scope.
IoT functionality currently supports simulated telemetry rather than requiring physical farm hardware.
